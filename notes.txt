Summary brainstorming stockmarket predictions

On possible input for ANN

0. information about general economic (interest rates etc) / stock „situation“ (via stock indices like s&p 500)
1. general accounting information (like revenue, assets, liabilities etc)
2. price movement itself
3. google statistics for sentiment analysis (number of searches, related searches, positve /negative)
4. probably some more high level information like evaluation of branch, management, competition etc.

→ are we actually going to try to predict single stock movement or rather prices of stock indices?


I think we also have to define a horizon for the predictions (and what we actually want to predict)

- since we have some calculation time and have to preprocess and decide about the input data we also have to define the prediction horizon 
- eg. we try to predict in advance the price of every days closing prices or every fridays closing prices etc. 
- i think this is a non-trivial part of what we have so resolve
- we also should decide if we want to predict actual prices (minimize price prediction error) or for example just make buy/sell predictions (to maximize profit)
